        <h2>Building the Page</h2>
        <p>First, I made a format using html and css. I tried my best to make it as clean and organized as possible. </p>
        <p>In the JavaScript file, I initialized Express.js using <code>const express = require('express'); const app = express();</code></p>

        <h2>Difficulties Encountered</h2>
        <p>During the process, I had a lot of difficulties undertanding what Express JS actually does and how to use it. I watched a few YouTube videos to help me understand and also looked up the different functions related to Express JS and how to use them. The biggest issue I really had was deciding which framework to use. There are so many to choose from, but ultimately I decided to use Express JS as it was the easiest for me to comprehend.</p>
